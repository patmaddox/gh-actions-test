# GitHub actions test

Learning some stuff about GitHub actions, particularly around environments and removing duplication.

- [x] action to do something on PR (staging environment)
- [x] action to do something on merge to main (prod environment)
- [x] extract shared action definition
- [ ] per-PR environments

This should only run when someone modifies `greetings.md`.
